                The sole survivor of the Last Great Time War, scarred by the terrible things he’d seen and done, the Ninth Doctor was an intense and emotional incarnation. Hiding his psychological trauma behind madcap wit and frivolity, he took Rose Tyler to see the end of the world, inspired Charles Dickens and showed that for once, everybody could live. He was still capable of great cruelty and anger though, killing Cassandra and torturing a lone Dalek into submission. After Rose defeated the Daleks using the power of the time vortex, the Doctor saved her by transferring that dangerous power into his own body. The strain destroyed his every cell and as Rose watched, his body exploded with raging energy…

               <h2> David Tennant | 2005 – 2010 </h2>
Waking on Christmas Day in his new form, the Doctor fought the Sycorax high above London, where he lost a hand but grew a new one with remnant regenerative power. Travelling with Rose and Mickey he battled Cybermen, werewolves and possibly, the Devil itself. Losing Rose in a parallel universe – but later leaving her with a half-human clone of himself – the Doctor travelled on. He hid as a human schoolmaster to spare the Family of Blood his wrath, he defeated his nemesis the Master once more and met River Song for the first time. Told that he would die when someone knocked four times, the Doctor remained defiant, but to no avail. Reeling from his confrontation with the Time Lords and fatally dosed with radiation, the Tenth Doctor’s song ended, as his violent regeneration burned the TARDIS and sent it crashing through space….

            <p class="description">
                Matt Smith | 2010 – 2013
Hugely energetic, occasionally flirtatious, and by his own admission, "a mad man", the Eleventh Doctor combined youthful looks with an old soul. Crashing into the lives of Amy Pond, and her boyfriend (later, husband) Rory, he solved the mystery of the time-erasing cracks in the universe, escaped his own death, restarted reality and even found time to marry River Song. A broken man after Amy and Rory were sent back in time by a Weeping Angel, and a Victorian-era Clara fell to her death, he decided to disappear. But it wasn't long before the lure of "the woman twice dead" brought the Doctor out of retirement. Finding his own tomb on the embattled Trenzalore and meeting a shameful, hidden past incarnation, started him on a path of redemption, teaming up with the Tenth Doctor to save Gallifrey rather than burn it. After sacrificing his life to defend Trenzalore, and granted a whole new cycle of incarnations by the Time Lords, the Doctor regenerated once more…

            <h1> Twelth  Doctor </h1>
            <p class="description">
                Peter Capaldi | 2013 – 2017
Granted a whole new regenerative cycle by the Time Lords, the Doctor experienced an explosive and unprecedented thirteenth regeneration, ending the Siege of Trenzalore. A new Doctor - with a sharp face, bushy brows and boggle eyes - faced a bewildered Clara, across the console. A Doctor who has seemingly forgotten how to fly the TARDIS!

The Twelfth Doctor immediately teamed up with his old chums The Paternoster Gang (Vastra, Jenny and Strax) as he dealt with a bout of post-regenerative stress. Luckily, Clara was on standby to help out. Together, they were manipulated unseen by The Master who had changed gender into Missy.

Along the way Clara lost her teacher boyfriend Danny Pink and almost left the TARDIS. But she and the Time Lord were inseparable (after some intervention by Santa), and went on to team up with UNIT’s Kate Stewart and Osgood once more and fought off the Zygons, Davros and faced Missy again.

A trip back to Gallifrey (after spending several billions year alone in the Confession Dial) saw the secret of the mythical Hybrid unveiled and a confrontation with the immortal Ashildr at the end of the universe.

After enjoying a few years off from saving the universe with his wife River Song, the Twelfth Doctor took on a teaching position at St. Luke’s University in Bristol where he met the inquisitive Bill Potts. With Nardole helping him guard The Vault (containing Missy), the trio embarked on numerous adventures in space and time.

And then came a fierce battle with Mondasian Cybermen – started by the return of a previous incarnation of The Master – which prompted Time Lord’s regeneration. The Doctor was able to fight it off long enough to meet his original self, the First Doctor, and embark on a partnership which would end in both men regenerating.

            <h1> Thirteenth Doctor </h1>
            <p class="description">
                Jodie Whittaker | 2018 – present
The Thirteenth Doctor is a livewire, full of energy and fizzing with excitement and wit from the very first moment we meet her! She’s a charismatic and confident explorer, dedicated to seeing all the wonders of the universe, championing fairness and kindness wherever she can.

After crash-landing to Earth, still a little dazed from her explosive regeneration, the Doctor takes a little time to remember her identity. But that doesn’t stop her from jumping into action to save the universe anyway – leaping from great heights and diving into deep space to find the TARDIS!

This Doctor loves to be surrounded by friends – in fact she treats her travelling companions Yaz, Ryan and Graham more like family, often boosting their confidence by telling them how great they are.

Like her previous incarnations, the Doctor is brave and selfless – a hero who will run towards danger without hesitation. Though she may be a fidget and a wanderer, she’ll always answer a call for aid when she hears it. In her own words, ‘When people need help, I never refuse.’
